                ESZTI Kondász is a Hungarian illustrator based in Budapest.
Her illustrations are rich in vivid and vibrant colours inspired by the world of Risography.

In her work she frequently incorporates symbolic elements, tarot motifs, and botanical details, while also exploring themes of feminism and mental health.

A distinctive feature of her style is the playful personification of inanimate objects around us often accompanied by a thoughtful play on double or alternative meanings`}
